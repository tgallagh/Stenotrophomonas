If you are loading enthought_python with OTHER modules / software 
'module load enthought_python' FIRST then the rest of your software.

Installing libs/modules /for/ this python or using it /in conjuction/ with other 
compiled code requires gcc/4.8.2 (not auto-loaded) 

To list the packages already installed in the enthought_python module:
' pip list --format=columns | grep -i your-target '
